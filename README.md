# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

We worked to create a functional chess board, in which the white side can have any chess piece, and the black side is restricted to a single king. Our model is capable of determining if that king is in checkmate, stalemate, or neither. 

It is also able to directly control how many of each white piece is available, using the options of having "exactly X number of Y piece", or "up to and including X number of Y piece".

Future plans include allowing black to have pieces other than just the black king, but that depends on how much free time our group has
