'''
As a reference:

when iteration through the board, the first variable (usually i) refers to the row it is in.
Ex. i = 0 means you are looking somewhere across the TOP of the chessboard.

The second variable (usually j) refers to the column it is in.

If i = 0 and j = 1, then the piece is at the top of the board, and second square from the left.
